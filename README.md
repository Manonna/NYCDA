# New York Code + Design Academy
### Full-stack web development intensive

This repository includes assignments, exercises and demo's I have made during my full-stack web development course at NYCDA.

### Assignments:
- **Compound-interest:**

Created an app that calculates compound interest.
For the mini-ukulele, the app was edited to have the logic in a module.
For the regular-ukulele, the app was made to take in a file with multiple customers.
For the mega-ukulele, the app will read multiple seperate customer files.

- **Country-info-app**

Created an app that outputs the name of a country and its top level domain when you enter the country name in the command line.

- **User-information-app**

Created an app that lists all users in a users.json file.
On a seperate route allows to search for these users by name and outputs a list of users with that name on a new page.
On another route has a form to add new users to the users.json file and then redirects to the page with the user list.
